    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>
      "At the moment, I am deeply invested in personal development and continuous learning. One of my main focuses has been on
      completing my GED (General Educational Development) certification. I have been taking GED classes to enhance my
      knowledge and skills in various subjects, including mathematics, science, social studies, and language arts.
      
      Additionally, I have recently embarked on a coding journey by enrolling in the Zomi Bootcamp, where I am working towards
      becoming a developer. This bootcamp provides an intensive and immersive learning experience, allowing me to acquire
      in-demand programming skills, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.
      Through these educational endeavors, I am nurturing my passion for personal growth and expanding my technical expertise.
      The GED classes have given me a well-rounded foundation in essential subjects, while the bootcamp equips me with the
      necessary skills to thrive in the rapidly evolving field of software development.
      
      I firmly believe that investing in personal development not only enhances my professional prospects but also empowers me
      to overcome challenges and contribute effectively to the ever-changing world of technology. I am excited to continue
      this journey of self-improvement and make meaningful contributions as a developer in the near future."

    <h4>Projects</h4>
    <p>
      Dog Website:
      I am currently working on a personal project to build a website dedicated to my beloved dog. The website will serve as a
      platform to share stories, photos, and information about my dog's adventures and personality. I am using my web
      development skills, such as HTML, CSS, to create an engaging and user-friendly website. By incorporating
      interactive features and visually appealing design elements, I aim to capture the essence of my dog's unique personality
      and create a memorable online experience for visitors.
      Organic Restaurant Brand:
      I have also taken on the exciting challenge of creating an organic restaurant brand. With a strong commitment to
      sustainability and healthy dining, I have developed a brand identity that reflects these values. From designing the
      logo, selecting color schemes, and developing marketing materials, I have crafted a cohesive visual identity that
      communicates the restaurant's organic and eco-friendly philosophy. Additionally, I have worked on menu development,
      sourcing organic ingredients, and creating a welcoming ambiance that aligns with the brand's values. The goal is to
      create a holistic dining experience that not only emphasizes delicious organic food but also promotes sustainable
      practices and healthy living.

    <h5>Skills</h5>
    <p>
      Language Skills:
      I am fluent in three languages, including [English,Dari or Farsi,Spanish]. This multilingual ability allows me to

      "I have a diverse range of hobbies and a passion for continuous learning. In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking,
      going to movies, traveling, and cooking. These activities not only provide me with relaxation and enjoyment but also
      allow me to explore different interests and expand my horizons.
      
      Coming from a different culture, I deeply understand the value of opportunity and the importance of embracing new
      experiences. Having lived in three different cultures, I have gained a unique perspective and appreciation for
      diversity. This exposure has enriched my understanding of people, customs, and traditions, fostering a sense of openness
      and adaptability.

      level and contribute positively to any environment or endeavor I pursue."
