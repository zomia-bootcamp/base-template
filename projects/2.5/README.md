You have three objectives with this project:
1) Practice building webpages with HTML
2) Practice replicating page designs using HTML 
3) Practice representing yourself as a web developer with the eventual goal of getting hired in a professional job

Features:
- Your app will have two pages called Home and Sample
- The pages should be linked using a nav bar. As a user, you should be able to go from one to the next by clicking the links in the nav bar

Your Home page should be a personal biography. It should contain:
- At least one photo of you
- At least one photo or image of something you have made or something you are interested in
- Some basic factual information about yourself
- Some information about things you are interested in
- A list of professional or academic projects you have completed. You may include images.
- A list skills or attributes about yourself (use an HTML table for this)
- A section where you communicate to an employer your unique talents, interests, hobbies, or passions - tell them what makes you different!


For your Sample page, you should re-create the attached images using HTML. 
- Do your best to re-create your page to be a perfect mirror image of the attached photo.
- There are two attached photos of what your page should look like: Top of Page.png should be the top of the page and Bottom of Page.png should be the bottom of the page.
- The meme to be use in the top of the page is attached
